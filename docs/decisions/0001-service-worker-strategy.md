# 0001: Service workers via `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox), not hand-rolled

## Status

Accepted

## Context

None of the five apps (`copilot`, `editor`, `ontology`, `sources`, `targets`) had a consistent service-worker strategy. `editor` and `ontology` each carry a hand-rolled service worker (`src/service-worker/index.ts` / `src/service-worker.ts`) built on SvelteKit's built-in `$service-worker` module — nearly identical copies of the SvelteKit docs' boilerplate, predating the monorepo migration. `copilot`, `sources`, and `targets` have none.

The goal is a modern, consistently-implemented service-worker strategy across all five apps: starting with simple asset/URL caching, with some apps eventually needing offline data-write support — client-side changes queued and synced back once connectivity returns.

## Decision

Adopt `vite-plugin-pwa`, via its SvelteKit-specific wrapper `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`, as the shared service-worker implementation, rather than hand-rolling and extending SvelteKit's native `$service-worker` pattern that `editor`/`ontology` already used.

The pilot started on `targets` (a from-scratch case, no existing service worker), then moved to `editor` once `targets` turned out not to exercise the pattern meaningfully — its Explorer UI never makes client-side `fetch()` calls to its own API, so the runtime-caching rule had nothing to actually cache. `editor` does make real client-side calls (`/check`, a GET; `/ai-assist/generate`, a POST), and already had a hand-rolled service worker to migrate rather than add from scratch, making it a better validation case. It was chosen over `ontology` (the other app with an existing hand-rolled worker) specifically to avoid compounding still-unproven service-worker mechanics with `ontology`'s Google OAuth/`protected/*` route complexity.

Getting `editor` building and fully validated — end to end, against a real `vite build`, real `wrangler dev` (workerd), and real D1 bindings, not just `vite dev`/`vite preview` approximations — surfaced real friction, all resolved and accepted as one-time integration cost rather than reasons to avoid the library:

- Disabling SvelteKit's native service-worker registration (`kit.serviceWorker.register: false`) so it doesn't conflict with the plugin's own registration.
- Working around a `workbox-window` module-resolution failure under pnpm's strict `node_modules` linking (undocumented in the official guide) by adding it as a direct devDependency.
- Adding an ambient TypeScript reference (`vite-plugin-pwa/client`) to type-check the `virtual:pwa-register/svelte` import.
- Disabling manifest generation (`manifest: false`) since no app icons exist yet — installability is deferred, not abandoned.
- `scope`/`base` must be set explicitly in the plugin config — without them, the service-worker registration URL resolves relative to the *current page's path* rather than the site root, producing a 404 on any route that isn't already at `/`.
- `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` silently defaults `workbox.navigateFallback` to `/` unless that key is explicitly present in the config (even as `undefined`). For an app that's server-rendered per-route rather than a static SPA shell, that default adds a catch-all navigation route that intercepts every page-level navigation *before* any other runtime-caching rule gets a chance to run — and does so for a fallback (`/`) that isn't meaningfully precached in the first place. Must be explicitly disabled per app unless a real offline app-shell is being built.
- Not a library bug, but a real testing gotcha worth recording: a tab isn't controlled by the service worker until its *next* navigation after that worker activates. Testing runtime caching against the same tab that just triggered install/activate (with no intervening reload) will look like caching silently doesn't work, when it's actually just standard service-worker lifecycle behavior.

With the pattern validated on `editor`, it was rolled out to the remaining apps, each verified the same way (build, typecheck/lint, a fast regression test, and a real `wrangler dev` + browser pass):

- `sources` — has a real client-side GET (`/analyze`), scoped the same way as `editor`'s `/check`.
- `targets` — gets asset precaching only. Its Explorer UI still makes no client-side `fetch()` calls to its own API (confirmed unchanged since the original pilot), so a runtime-caching rule here would be untested, dead config — exactly the problem that moved the pilot to `editor` in the first place.
- `ontology` — has real Google OAuth (`/auth/*`, via `hooks.server.ts`) and `/protected/*` routes serving per-user data, alongside one genuinely public client-side GET (`/examples`). Its runtime-caching rule is a strict **allowlist** matching only `/examples` by exact path, not a denylist of "everything except known-bad paths" — a denylist is one accidental omission away from caching something authenticated, whereas an allowlist excludes anything not deliberately added, protected or not. Verified directly: a same-origin GET to a protected route (`/protected/concept/create/next-sense`) produces no cache entry anywhere, even though it reaches the service worker's fetch handler.

`copilot` is intentionally out of scope for this rollout for now.

## Alternatives considered

**Hand-rolled, extending SvelteKit's native `$service-worker`** — the pattern already proven in `editor`/`ontology`, generalized into a shared factory each app's own `src/service-worker.ts` would call. This was the initial direction, and was actually implemented and reverted once before landing on this decision. It was set aside because of what it would cost to build and maintain by hand as requirements grow:

- No caching-strategy library: cache expiration, `maxEntries`, and correct handling of opaque cross-origin responses would all need to be built and tested in-house. The current `editor`/`ontology` service workers already show the risk here — they cache every successful GET response indefinitely with no expiration, until the next deploy wipes the whole cache.
- No `workbox-background-sync` equivalent: the offline data-write-sync goal would require building an IndexedDB-backed request queue and replay logic entirely from scratch, rather than reusing a maintained implementation.
- No dev-mode service-worker testing — native service workers only run against a real `vite build` output.
- Coarser precache invalidation: a deploy bump wipes the *entire* cache via the `version` string, rather than Workbox's per-file content-hash revisioning.

Given the project's longer-term offline-sync ambitions, the ongoing cost of hand-building and maintaining Workbox-equivalent functionality outweighed the one-time integration friction of adopting the library.

## Consequences

- The shared implementation now depends on `vite-plugin-pwa`/`@vite-pwa/sveltekit` and its Workbox internals, with the workarounds above baked into each app's config as the cost of that dependency.
- `editor`'s and `ontology`'s old hand-rolled service workers have been removed as part of this migration. `editor`, `ontology`, `sources`, and `targets` are all now on the shared implementation. `copilot` is deliberately not, for now.
- Each app carries its own small `src/service-worker.test.ts` (a fast, server-less regression test against the compiled `sw.js`) rather than a `wrangler dev`-backed E2E harness — see the test file itself for the full reasoning. It isn't a replacement for the manual `wrangler dev` + browser verification that validated each app; it's a guard against regressing the two config gotchas above once that manual pass has confirmed things work.
- Update-detection/reload-prompting is unaffected either way: it's already solved independently via SvelteKit's `updated` store and the shared `UpdateToast` component (`packages/ui`) — though `UpdateToast` now also accepts an external `needs_refresh`/`on_refresh` signal so apps on this plugin can drive it from the plugin's own `useRegisterSW().needRefresh` instead.
- Manifest/installability, deferred in the pilot pending real icons, is resolved: `editor`, `ontology`, `sources`, and `targets` each have a generated favicon and PWA manifest icon set (`scripts/dx/generate_favicons.ts`, `scripts/dx/generate_manifest_icons.ts` — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-generate-an-apps-icons)) and a real `manifest` object in place of `manifest: false`. `copilot` remains out of scope, per this ADR's original rollout decision.
