## 🔌 API

### 1. Concept Search API

- `GET /search?q={query}` — Searches ontology concepts by stem, gloss, or category.
  - **Query Params:**
    - `q` (`string`, required) — Search term.
    - `scope` (`stems` | `glosses` | `all`, optional, default `stems`) — Search scope.
    - `category` (`string`, optional) — Filter by grammatical category.
  - **Example:** `/search?q=love&scope=all`

### 2. Simplification Hints API

- `GET /simplification_hints?complex_term={term}` — Retrieves simplification hints for complex terms.
  - **Query Params:**
    - `complex_term` (`string`, required) — Complex term to query.
    - `category` (`string`, optional) — Grammatical category.
  - **Example:** `/simplification_hints?complex_term=disciple`

### 3. Concept Usage Examples API

- `GET /examples?concept={concept}&part_of_speech={pos}` — Retrieves usage examples for an ontology concept along with current translation status.
  - **Query Params:**
    - `concept` (`string`, required) — Concept stem-sense identifier.
    - `part_of_speech` (`string`, required) — Part of speech (e.g. `Noun`, `Verb`).
    - `source` (`string`, optional) — Source reference filter.
  - **Example:** `/examples?concept=love-B&part_of_speech=Noun`

## 💻 Local Development & Setup

### 1. Configure Local Auth

`apps/ontology/.env.local` is created by the monorepo's onboarding step (`bun run setup`, from the root), including a generated dev `AUTH_SECRET`. Fill in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` there — grab it from the same Google Cloud Console client as `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`. The OAuth callback redirects to `http://localhost:3056/auth/callback`.

(If `.env.local` doesn't exist yet, or is missing a var after pulling a `.env` template change, run `bun run setup:env` from the root to (re)generate it.)

### 2. Running Locally

From the **monorepo root**:

```bash
# Run Ontology dev server only
bun run dev:ontology

# Or run all apps concurrently
bun run dev
```

Or from within `apps/ontology`:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### 3. Loading Local Database

To load the local D1 SQLite database dump into Miniflare state:

```bash
bun run db:load:ontology
```

For complete database tooling and snapshots documentation, see [tools/databases/README.md](../../tools/databases/README.md).

### 4. Complex Terms Synchronization

Complex terms and simplification hints are synchronized from Google Sheets every 12 hours, or manually on demand.

- **Scheduled**: the separate [`scheduler`](../scheduler/README.md) Worker's cron calls `POST /scheduled/sync` through a service binding, which syncs complex terms and then the semantic search index (section 5). The endpoint only accepts the shared `SCHEDULER_TOKEN`. This app can't hold the cron itself, because SvelteKit's Cloudflare adapter never calls a `scheduled` export ([ADR 0017](../../docs/decisions/0017-scheduled-work-via-scheduler-worker.md)).
- **Manual Sync via UI**: Sign in to the app, navigate to `/protected`, and click **"Sync Complex Terms Now"** (complex terms only).
- **Testing the scheduled sync locally**: with `SCHEDULER_TOKEN` set in `apps/ontology/.env.local` and `bun run dev:ontology` running:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCHEDULER_TOKEN" http://localhost:3056/scheduled/sync
  ```

  Locally, the complex-terms half runs for real, but the embedding half can't reach Vectorize (see section 5).

### 5. Semantic Search Index

The **Semantic Search** scope finds related concepts by comparing embeddings (vectors describing each concept's meaning) stored in a Cloudflare Vectorize index, `ontology-concepts`, bound as `VECTORIZE_Concepts`. See [ADR 0016](../../docs/decisions/0016-semantic-search-via-vectorize-embeddings.md) for why.

The index holds derived data only. It is rebuilt from D1 by the same 12-hour scheduled sync as the complex terms (the embedding sync runs right after them), so it never needs a manual rebuild. Each run re-embeds only concepts whose gloss or how-to hint changed. The **"Sync Complex Terms Now"** button doesn't touch embeddings.

- **One-time setup** (per Cloudflare account; production and preview share the index). Create the index before the first deploy that binds it, or the deploy fails:

  ```bash
  cd apps/ontology && bunx wrangler vectorize create ontology-concepts --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
  ```

  The dimensions must match `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` in `@tabitha/ai`. The next scheduled sync then fills the index from scratch, which takes about 3,800 embedding calls (run it by hand to skip the wait; see [`apps/scheduler/README.md`](../scheduler/README.md)). Deleting and recreating the index (for example, after changing the dimensions) just triggers another full fill.

- **Before the first fill**, confirm the AI Gateway serves embeddings:

  ```bash
  cd tools/gateway && bun run verify:embedding
  ```

- **Local development**: Vectorize has no local simulation, so a semantic search locally shows only the normal stem results and logs an error that the binding "needs to be run remotely". That's expected.
