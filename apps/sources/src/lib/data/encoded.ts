/**
 * Reports which of `references` actually hold a semantic encoding.

 * Deliberately separate from `get_verse_statuses` in `status.ts`, even though both are batch
 * lookups against the same `Sources` table: `status` and `semantic_encoding` are populated by
 * two independent migrations (the team's verse-status CSV, and the TBTA export) that never
 * consult each other, so a verse's workflow status is not a reliable stand-in for whether its
 * encoding actually exists. Giving this its own endpoint means a caller who wants to know "is
 * there an encoding?" asks that question directly, rather than reading a `status` field and
 * being expected to know it answers something else.
